# Module three challenge

## Description

-My motivation was to build a javascript program that met Userstory, acceptance criteria and learn more about javascript in the process.

-It solved the problem of password-protecting sensitive data and making sure passwords met parameters.
-I learned the ins and outs of javascript and how to apply it to real-world situations.
